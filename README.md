Project Title: RUHungry Restaurant Management System

Project Description:

The RUHungry Restaurant Management System is a simulation-based application designed to manage the operations of a fictitious restaurant, RUHungry. This system is developed in Java and demonstrates a variety of object-oriented programming concepts, including data structures, file handling, and algorithm implementation. The project is an excellent showcase of problem-solving skills, system design, and coding proficiency in a real-world scenario.

Key Features:

Menu Management:

The system reads and processes a menu from an input file, organizing it into categories and individual dishes.
Each dish is associated with specific ingredients, allowing the system to manage the availability and pricing of dishes dynamically.
The menu is stored using parallel arrays and linked lists to efficiently handle and retrieve data.
Stock Management:

A custom hash table with chaining is implemented to manage the stock of ingredients.
The system supports adding new stock, updating existing stock levels, and finding specific ingredients by either name or ID.
The stock management system is tightly integrated with the menu, ensuring that dish availability is correctly determined based on ingredient stock levels.
Transaction Processing:

The system tracks all transactions, including orders, donations, and restocking events.
Transactions are recorded in a linked list, with detailed information about each event, including whether it was successful and the associated profit.
The system can compute the total profit for the day, taking into account successful and unsuccessful transactions.
Customer Management:

The system simulates customer interactions, including seating guests, processing orders, and managing parties that leave the restaurant.
A queue is used to manage the order of parties leaving the restaurant, ensuring a realistic simulation of restaurant operations.
File Handling:

The system reads input data from multiple files to set up the menu, stock, and tables, showcasing proficiency in file handling and data parsing.
Technical Highlights:

Data Structures: Implementation of hash tables, linked lists, queues, and parallel arrays.
Algorithm Development: Custom algorithms for seating guests, processing orders, and updating stock levels.
Object-Oriented Design: Extensive use of classes, objects, and methods to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
File I/O: Efficient reading and processing of data from external files to initialize the system.
Use Cases:

Demonstrates the ability to design and implement a complex system from scratch.
Showcases problem-solving skills through the handling of real-world scenarios such as stock management and customer service.
Highlights the ability to integrate multiple programming concepts into a cohesive application.
Conclusion: The RUHungry Restaurant Management System is a comprehensive project that demonstrates advanced programming skills and the ability to manage complex systems. It is an ideal project to showcase to potential employers as evidence of technical proficiency, creativity, and the ability to tackle real-world problems through software development.
